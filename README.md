# âš¡ Zigil

A metaprogramming module for Zig.

## Traits

A trait is a set of conditions that a given type should satisfy.
They take the form of a function that takes in the type. Like this:

```zig
const is_float_vector = zigil.Trait.isVector(.{ .child = .isFloat(.{}) });
is_float_vector.assert(SomeType);
```

If the type fails to satisfy the conditions, the `assert` function will emit a
compile error:

```zig
error: [trait trace] The type `@Vector(8, u8)` is required to satisfy the trait `is-vector[child => is-float]`.
                              The type must be a vector whose child satisfy the trait is-float.
                          [trait trace] The type `u8` is required to satisfy the trait `is-float`.
                              The type must be a floating point.
                          [trait trace] The type `u8` is required to satisfy the trait `is-kind[.float]`.
                              The type is an integer.
                          [trait `error.IsInt`]
```

### Custom traits

You can define your own custom traits using the `Trait.Result` type.

```zig
fn customTrait(comptime T: type) zigil.Trait.Result {
    comptime {
        // initialize a passing result
        const r = zigil.Trait.Result.init(
            // with the type it's supposed to apply to
            T,
            // with a descriptive kebab-cased name
            "custom-trait",
            // And a meaningfull expectation of the trait.
            "I expect this and that from the type.",
        );

        // compute your conditions
        const condition = ...;

        // If the type fails to satisfy the condition, return the result with an error.
        if (!condition) return r.withFailure(.{
            // this error will be used by `Trait.expect` and `Trait.expectError`, they're useful
            // for testing your trait and making sure it fails where it's supposed to.
            .@"error" = error.CustomError,

            // You can setup a few useful messages. By default, "expect"  will be the initial 
            // description of the trait, the "actual" and "repair" sections will be empty.
            .expect = "I expect this particulary.",
            .actual = "What happened instead was that: ...",
            .repair = "You might fix everything by using this instead...",

            // This is the name of the condition it failed, it will help the name of the trait be
            // more precise like `custom-trait[that-condition]` instead of just "custom-trait"
            .option = "that-condition",
        });

        // The trait can also depend on a type satisfying another trait
        if (r.propagateFail(
            // most of the time, it's the same type, but not always
            T, another_trait, .{
                // This options will help display a good trace by naming the trait with the other
                // trait like this:Â `custom-trait[=> another-trait]` instead of just `custom-trait`
                .option = .withTraitName("=> {s}"),
                // The expect message can also be useful to explain why the other trait is required.
                .expect = .str("The type must satisfy both traits because ..."),
            },
            // we return the result if it's a fail.
        )) |fail| return fail;
    }
}

const custom_trait = Trait{ .result = customTrait };

comptime {
    custom_trait.assert(SomeType);
}
```
